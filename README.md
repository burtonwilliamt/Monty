Miscelaneous discord bot. When I don't know where to put a feature, I put it here.

## Naming
I'm not really sure what to call this bot. Currently I'm using "Computer" as in "Computer... bring up celery man.", but I'm also considering a more specific [fictional computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_computers). Leading contenders:

* Hal9000
* Multivac
* Deep Thought
* F.R.I.D.A.Y.
