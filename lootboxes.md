How to lootboxes work:
	Make it really easy to press the button and perform another loot
	Looting should have a delay (rummaging, unlocking, progress bar, etc).
	Opening a lootbox costs money.
	/loot and choose the thing you're looting
	makes an info tab of the thing you're looting
	Below the picture is a list of possible items with their chances and values. Undiscovered items have their chance shown but not their name.
	Cost to loot is on the button.
	Where should we put the output of the loot?
